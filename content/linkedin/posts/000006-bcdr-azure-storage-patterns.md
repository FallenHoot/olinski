An enterprise client told me they had a full BCDR strategy for cloud storage.

I asked if they had tested failover in the last six months.

They had not.

A backup is not a continuity plan. A continuity plan is not a disaster recovery plan. Most enterprises have the first and call it the third.

I have worked through enough real recovery events to know that the gap between "we have backups" and "we can recover in four hours" is where the actual work lives.

There is a specific pattern involving multi-region strategy, automation boundaries, and validation testing that closes most of that gap.

I wrote it up.

When did your team last run a real recovery drill, not just verify the backup job completed?
