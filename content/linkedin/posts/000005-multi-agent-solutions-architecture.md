A team showed me their multi-agent prototype. It was impressive.

Then I asked: what happens when Agent B runs before Agent A finishes?

Silence.

One agent is a tool. Two agents that share state without coordination is a production incident waiting to happen.

I have seen cascading failures from stale context, ownership gaps when multiple agents touch the same outcome, and recovery processes that no one thought through because the happy path worked fine in demos.

The architecture problems in multi-agent systems are not AI problems. They are distributed systems problems with an AI skin on them.

I wrote about the patterns that actually hold when you move from prototype to production.

What is the hardest coordination challenge you have hit when building multi-agent workflows?
